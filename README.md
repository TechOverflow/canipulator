The **CANipulator** is a CAN bus interface that allows the bridging, translation, baud-matching, or manipulation of traffic on two CAN networks between nodes. It was designed with automotive environments in mind, but can also be used in other CAN systems. At the heart is a 160 MHz ESP32-C6, which offers not only dual TWAI (Two-Wire Automotive Interface) controllers, but also 802.11b/g/n/ax WiFi, BLE 5.3, native USB, and many other features.
